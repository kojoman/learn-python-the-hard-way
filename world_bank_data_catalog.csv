It facilitates strategic dialogue between Management and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention.  The World Bank has systems—on which it continuously improves—for measuring and monitoring both development results and its own performance. These systems are complemented by independent evaluations. With the Results Measurement System, which was adopted for the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA13) in 2002, the Bank became the first multilateral development institution to use a framework with quantitative indicators to monitor results and performance. The Corporate Scorecard expands this approach to the entire World Bank covering both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and IDA.  The Corporate Scorecard uses an integrated results and performance framework, which is organized in a four-tier structure that groups indicators along the results chain (see “Summary of the Corporate Scorecard” ). Two of the tiers track elements of development results (Tiers I and II), and the other two capture elements of performance (Tiers III and IV). As the Summary shows, the Corporate Scorecard monitors, at an aggregate level, whether the Bank is functioning efficiently and adapting itself successfully (Tier IV), and whether it is managing its operations and services effectively (Tier III) to support countries in achieving results (Tier II) in the context of global development progress and priorities (Tier I).

The project collects nationally representative data that focus mainly on performance and quality of service delivery in primary schools and at frontline health facilities. This partnership between the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the African Economic Research Consortium brings together development economists and sector specialists. The objective is to reposition the dialogue on human development in Africa within the context of effectiveness of public spending and accountability for service delivery. Why such an agenda? Accountability for public resources: developing country governments allocate roughly a third of budgets to education and health. Demands for accountability for the efficient use of public resources—from citizens and tax payers in developed or developing countries alike—are gaining in prominence, in part, because of the global economic situation. Accountability depends upon measurement: without consistent and accurate information on the quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians to assess how service providers are performing, to work towards corrective action, and ultimately bring about improvements. There is little robust and representative evidence of what teachers and health workers do during a typical work-day, their levels of ability, knowledge and skills, how teachers perform their teaching activities and how well health workers diagnose and treat their patients.",http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/service-delivery-indicators,Time Series,,,"SSA, LMY, IDA",Other (Facility),"Varies by data set, but generally includes rural-urban and provider type (public/private).","Three (Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal), with more to come.",,"Education, Health",No Fixed Schedule,13-Jul-13,7/13/2013,sdi@worldbank.org,Query tool,,0,"Service Delivery Indicators, The World Bank",,http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/service-delivery-indicators,2010 - 2012,
